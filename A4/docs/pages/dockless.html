            The pronto dataset is limited since it only shows us riders picking-up/dropping-off bikes from fixed locations
            (stations). So we don't know where riders would have actually wanted to go. To get this information,
            we obtained a second dataset of dockless bikes in Seattle. Since riders are free to drop off these bikes
            wherever they want, we can use this data to get a sense of how well aligned pronto bike stations were with
            "popular biking destinations".
        </p>
           <p>The same base map as in the first page. But this time we'll encode the number of places of
           interest from each pronto station. We'll have the same plot for Portland and SF, showing
           that Pronto was further away from places of interest</p>
            <p>The second viz will be a refined version of the interactive map on the right. We set up a
            kernel density estimator that modeled the density of Seattle link stations. We've plotted this
                density on a neighborhood level on the map. We then used a technique called Stein Variational Gradient
                Descent that iteratively moves points towards locations of high probability density, while
                simultaneously keeping the points further apart. Applied to Pronto stations, the interaction on the
                right show us how we could move the Pronto stations so that they were closer to transit stations
                but not too clustered in a few areas. This will give the viewer a sense of how far off the current
                orientation was from transit locations. The goal is to have this be a single-click animation rather
                than a slider.
            </p>
            <p>
                The plot: The same interaction as before, but this time the slider shows
                "how can we move pronto stations so they are better aligned with where people actually want to take bikes?"
