            It’s natural to blame the rainy weather and hilly topology in Seattle. Seattle may simply not like biking. After all, it’s not a good experience always biking in drizzling rain and going up and down hills. However, the data shows that Seattlers like to bike!

        <h3>Is Seattle Just Too Rainy to Bike?</h3>
        <p>
            No! 
            The data suggests that Seattelite's tend to bike even in the rain.

        <h3>Is Seattle Just Too Hilly to Bike?</h3>
        <p>
            No!
            Another plausible reason for Pronto's failure is that Seattle is too hilly to bike.
            We're working on a visualization demonstrating that Seattelites tend to bike despite the elevation, and that there are routes to get around the city that avoid the hills. 
            Elevation is also not the reason behind Pronto's failure.

            So, the question is: why?
