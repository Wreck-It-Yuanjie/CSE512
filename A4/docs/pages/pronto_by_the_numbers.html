                Despite having a robust biking infrastructure, Seattle is one of the few cities where a public bike sharing system has been decommissioned. Pronto Cycle Share, a non-profit bikeshare program, was launched in October 2014 and shut down in March 2017 after the city decided to eliminate the budget for the bikeshare program. The rise and fall of the Pronto Cycle Share provides a unique case study on the design and implementation of micro-mobility networks in a major US city.
