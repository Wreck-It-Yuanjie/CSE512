Other than Seattle, docked share bikes are thriving in the other two cities. We discuss three dimensions of scale: spatial coverage, density of bike stations, and density of available bikes. The map below shows the spatial coverage does differ across three cities! Pronto only covers 7.95 square miles of Seattle, while the numbers are 35.08 and 36.88 in San Francisco and Portland. Nevertheless, their bike station densities are similar, and they are 7.3 (Seattle), 7.45 (San Francisco), and 5.21 (Portland) stations/square mile, respectively. </h3>
