            Show that Pronto was further away from transit and places of interest compared to docked bikeshare
            services in Portland and San Francisco.
            We will have two main viz here
        </p>
               <p>The same base map as in the first page. But this time we'll encode the number of places of
               interest from each pronto station. We'll have the same plot for Portland and SF, showing
               that Pronto was further away from places of interest</p>
                <p>The second viz will be a refined version of the interactive map on the right. We set up a
                kernel density estimator that modeled the density of Seattle link stations. We've plotted this
                    density on a neighborhood level on the map. We then used a technique called Stein Variational Gradient
                    Descent that iteratively moves points towards locations of high probability density, while
                    simultaneously keeping the points further apart. Applied to Pronto stations, the interaction on the
                    right show us how we could move the Pronto stations so that they were closer to transit stations
                    but not too clustered in a few areas. This will give the viewer a sense of how far off the current
                    orientation was from transit locations. The goal is to have this be a single-click animation rather
                    than a slider.

                <p>
                    We'll have the same interactive maps for a few other places of interest (e.g. restaurants). The
                    user can select these from a drop-down and run their what-if-we-could-move-the-stations scenarios.
