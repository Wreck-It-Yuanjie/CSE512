  <h2>Were Docked Bikes Too Restrictive?</h2>
    <p> The pronto dataset is limited since it only shows us riders picking-up/dropping-off bikes from
    fixed locations (stations). So we don't know where riders would have actually wanted to go.
        To get this information, we obtained a second dataset of dockless bikes in Seattle. Since riders are free
        to drop off these bikes wherever they want, we can use this data to get a sense of how well aligned pronto
        bike stations were with "popular biking destinations".

        The plot on the left: blue circles show locations where dockless bikes were dropped-off, with size encoding
        the number of such trips (bigger circles means more popular destinations). The red diamonds show locations of
        pronto stations. We're working on moving this from lat/long space to an actual map.

        The plot on the right: The same interaction as before, but this time the slider shows "how can we move pronto
          stations so they are better aligned with where people actually want to take bikes?"
