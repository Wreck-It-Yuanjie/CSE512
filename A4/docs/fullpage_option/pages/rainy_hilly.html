        This page is intended to get some of the naive reasons behind pronto's failure's out of the way,
        before we delve into some actuall plausible reasons backed by research.
    </p>

    <h3>Is Seattle Just Too Rainy to Bike?</h3>
    <p>
        One reason for Pronto's failure is that Seattle gets too much rainfall for a good biking culture.
        We're working on a visualization demonstrating that Seattle and Portland are pretty similar in terms
        of rain, but Portland does have a successful docked bikeshare system. The radial diagrams on the left
        are templates we'll use to plot the amount of rainfall in Portland compared to Seattle.
        We also have data suggesting that Seattelite's tend to bike even in the rain.
        So the rain is probably not the reason behind Pronto's failure.
    </p>
    <h3>Is Seattle Just Too Hilly to Bike?</h3>
    <p>
        Another plausible reason for Pronto's failure is that Seattle is too hilly to bike.
        We're working on a visualization demonstrating that Seattelites tend to bike despite the elevation, and that
        there are routes to get around the city that avoid the hills. We also have data on San Francisco, another
        hilly city where a docked bikeshare flourished.
        So elevation is probably not the reason behind Pronto's failure.
