        We have visualizations showing the coverage of the pronto stations versus coverage of stations from
        successful bikeshare services in Portland and San Francisco. We're calculating an enclosing conex polygon
        around the stations. This shows that Pronto stations did not sufficiently cover the city.
        We have implemented this viz in ArcGis, which gives us a shape file. We'll now transfer this to D3.
