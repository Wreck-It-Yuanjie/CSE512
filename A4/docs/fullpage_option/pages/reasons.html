        <h2>Reasons for Pronto's Failure</h2>
        <p>
            We've ruled out two naive reasons. Now let's look at what research suggests. The chart below is
            copied from a research article that categorizes plausible reasons for Pronto's failure. We will
            have a similar chart with a smaller set of reasons that we'll pursue. Similar to this chart, we'll use
            color coding to segment the reasons by their relative importance.
